# Gopher Express

Gopher Express is an open source Gopher Extension to kickstart your next great idea. Need inspiration? Visit the [Gopher Extension Idea Board](https://trello.com/b/AhYnpKqa/gopher-extension-ideas).

## What does it do?

Out of the box, it's a simple email reminder.

If you send an email to [anything]@[your-extension-domain].gopher.email, you will receive en email reminder in 15 minutes.
]

## How does it work?

* When a user emails [anything]@[your-extension].gopher.email, Gopher fires the `task.created` webhook to your extension, which is handled in `routes/gopherWebhooks`.

* When a reminder becomes due, Gopher fires the `task.triggered` webhook, again handled in `routes/gopherWebhooks.js`

* User settings and the OAuth connection process are handled in `public/index.html`.

The code is well commented with examples and links to docs throughout, so have a look around.

## Exporting / Local Development

Gopher Express just uses Node.js and Express, making it very portable.

To run your extension locally:

* export to Github or Download (in Glitch's advanced settings)
* run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`
* to allow the Gopher API to send webhooks to your extension,
  run `npm run ngrok` to map a publicly accessible domain to your local install
* copy `.env.example` into `.env` and add your environment details
* edit your extension's settings on gopher.email to reflect your new environment.

From here you can easily deploy your extension to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Zeit](https://zeit.co/now) or any other Node.js platform.
