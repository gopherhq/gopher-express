 * ABOUT THIS FILE:
 * Gopher and your extenion mainly interact with Webhooks, as demonstrated 
 * in this file.
 * 
 * To illustrate:
 * 
 * -> (event) -> Gopher API -> Webhook (JSON) -> Your Extension
 *                                                   | 
 * <- (action) <- Gopher API <- Response (JSON) <- (Custom Logic)
 * 
 * Examples of events: emails being received, tasks updated, extension installed
 * Examples of custom logic: add to a crm, create todo, make additional API calls to Gopher
 * Examples of actions: send an email, save data, reschedule a task
 * 
 * More about webhooks: https://docs.gopher.email/v1.0/reference#webhooks
